# Saline-Drip-Monitoring-System
- In hospitals, Saline is fed to patients to treat dehydration and thus improve their health. In current health care measures, whenever a saline is fed to any patient, the patient needs to be continuously monitored by a nurse or any caretaker. Almost in all of the hospital, a nurse or caretaker is responsible for monitoring the saline level continuously without any interruptions. Due to the negligence and inattentiveness towards saline completion by doctors, nurses or caretaker of the patients and lack of nurses with sufficient skills in hospitals and their excessive workload, a huge number of patients are being harmed in the hospitals. Hence to prevent the patient from getting harmed and protect their lives during saline feeding period, the saline level monitoring and control system have been developed.
